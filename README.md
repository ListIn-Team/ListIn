Issues: We tried adding a feature that would display the ratings of the podcasts in the representation of five stars. We found the plug-in that the tutorial used that would allow for this functionality (https://wbotelhos.com/raty/). However, we ran into jQuery bugs when we tried to apply the rating system to the website. So unfortunately, this functionality is not used in this version of the website. 

Known Bugs: No known bugs at the moment.
